Sagri Inc. is a pioneering social impact Climate Tech Startup focused on Agriculture founded in 2018 with the vision of "realizing the coexistence of humanity and the earth." We utilize satellite data and AI technology to address global food crises and climate change challenges. Our core products - Actaba ( Land Use Categorization) , Detaba ( Crop Mapping) and related services - offer innovative solutions in agricultural management and optimization. We are now developing an advanced MRV (Measure, Report, and Verify) and decarbonization platform for agricultural enterprises, aimed at revolutionizing sustainability practices in the agricultural sector.


The Role

We are seeking a highly skilled and experienced Lead Remote Sensing Engineer to lead the development and implementation of our remote sensing solutions for our MRV (Measure, Report, and Verify) decarbonization platform. In this role, you will be at the forefront of our efforts to utilize satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies to promote sustainable farming practices, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance the accuracy of our agricultural monitoring systems.

Responsibilities

Lead the design, development, and deployment of remote sensing systems and methodologies for the MRV decarbonization platform
Work closely with engineering and operations teams to understand requirements and translate them into effective mapping and visualization solutions
Develop algorithms and models to analyze satellite imagery and other remote sensing data for agricultural monitoring and carbon measurement
Create interactive and visually engaging maps and visualizations to illustrate agricultural activities and carbon emissions
Utilize GIS tools and techniques to generate accurate and detailed maps, integrating real-time data for dynamic representation
Ensure remote sensing processes and outputs' accuracy, reliability, and scalability
Provide technical leadership and mentorship to junior remote sensing engineers and other team members
Work closely with domain experts, such as soil scientists and carbon market specialists, to ensure the integrity and applicability of remote sensing data
Develop and implement the best remote sensing data acquisition, processing, and analysis practices
Communicate complex remote sensing concepts and findings to internal and external stakeholders effectively

Ideal Profile
